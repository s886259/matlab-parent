<h1>Sound Recorder</h1>

<br>

Settings button on the recorder display panel or from the
  <em>  <strong>Detection>Sound Recorder>Recorder Settings</strong></em> menu command.

<h3>Raw Data Source</h3>
<p>Select the data source for the sound recorder. All sources of raw audio data within PAMGUARD
  will be listed. 
</p>
<h3>Recording Options</h3>
<h4 class="style1">Automatic Restarts</h4>
<p>Recording will stop whenever PAMGUARD data acquisition is paused or PAMGUARD is closed. Check this box
  if you want recording to restart in it's previous state (stopped, 
  automatic cycle or continuous) when PAMGUARD
  is restarted. 
</p>
<h4 class="style1">Enable Buffer</h4>
<p>Enter the length of the history buffer that will be added to the start of recordings started by
  pressing the Continuous + Buffer button.  </p>
<p>
Note that buffering audio data can take a lot of memory and that writing large data buffers
at the start of a file can take considerable time, which may make PAMGUARD unstable. Buffers of up to
a minute in length at sample rates of 100 kHz are generally Ok. 

<h3>Select Output Folder</h3>
<p>Select the folder that recorded files will be stored in. Note that recordings can 
  take a considerable amount of space, so it may be worth having a dedicated drive for this 
  purpose. 
  
</p>
<h3>File Name and Type</h3>
<p>File names are always based on the current PC clock date (which should have been 
  <a href="../../../mapping/NMEA/docs/ClockOptions.html">set from the GPS)</a>. You may also enter
a character string to the start of the file. In the example shown, a recording started at 
22:51:40 on 12 January 2007 would have the name PAM20070112_225140.wav.
</p>
<p>
WAVE (WAV), AU and AIFF (AIF) formats are currently supported. 
 
<h3>Maximum File Lengths</h3>
<p>Set the maximum length of single files either as a length in seconds and / or a 
  size in Megabytes. Although you are likely to store files on hard drives, it is generally
  sensible to limit the size of single files such that a single file will fit on a writable CD or DVD. 
  
</p>
<h3>Automatic Recordings</h3>
<p>Set the interval between automatic recordings and the length of automatic recordings
  in seconds.
