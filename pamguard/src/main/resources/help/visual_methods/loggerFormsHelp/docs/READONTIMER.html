<h1>READONTIMER Property</h1>

<p>The READONTIMER Property is used to make a form automatically save it's data at regular fixed intervals. </p>

<p>Forms using READONTIMER should therefore only contain controls which can be updated automatically, such as times and NMEA data.  </p>
<p>READONTIMER is typically used for collecting analogue data (not yet implemented) or  NMEA data 
such as weather information at fixed intervals. </p>

<h3><u>Required Fields</u></h3>
  
<p><b>Autoupdate</b>
 <p>The time interval in seconds at which the form  should be automatically saved</p>
