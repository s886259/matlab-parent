<h1>READONGPS Property</h1>

<p>The READONGPS Property is used to make a form automatically save it's data every time new GPS data 
are collected. </p>
<p>Forms using READONGPS should therefore only contain controls which can be updated automatically, such as times and NMEA data.  </p>
<p>READONGPS is typically used for collecting other NMEA data, such as weather information, each time GPS data are read. </p>
