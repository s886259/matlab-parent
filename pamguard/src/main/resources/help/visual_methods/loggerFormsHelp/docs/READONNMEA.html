<h1>READONNMEA Property</h1>

<p>The READONNMEA Property is used to make a form automatically save every time a specified NMEA string arrives. </p>

<p>Typically, READONMEA is used if you want to store every instance of a particular string. In this case, you will need to 
build a form containing a number of fields of types NMEACHAR, NMEAFLOAT and NMEAINT which will read individual values 
from the NMEA string and store them in database columns. </p>

<p>Note that this is very different to reading on a timer which will only ever store the latest data from a particular string. </p> 


<h3><u>Required Fields</u></h3>
  
<p><b>Autoupdate</b>
 <p>The time interval in seconds at which the form  should be automatically saved</p>
