<h3>GPS data</h3>
<p>
Here, the latitude, longitude, time, date, true course and speed as derived from the <i>ship's</i> GPS are displayed.
</p>
<p>
The information area can be displayed or hidden using the map pop-up menu.
</p>

<h3>Cursor Position</h3>
<p>
The cursor position in latitude and longitude is displayed, by converting screen coordinates to real-world coordinates.
</p>
<p>
  The range and bearing from the ship's GPS to the cursor is also shown here. This will allow range estimates, for example, between the ship and areas where bearing lines cross.
  </p>

</p>
<h3>Other Measurements</h3>
<p>
To measure between two arbitrary points on the map, press the 'Measure With Mouse' 
button on the map control panel and drag the cursor across the screen. An additional
display panel will appear above the controls showing the range and bearing from where the mouse was 
pressed down to where it has been dragged to.
