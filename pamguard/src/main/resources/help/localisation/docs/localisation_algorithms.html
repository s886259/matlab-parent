<b>The Forward and Inverse Problem.</b><br><br><br>


In an ideal world the problem of localisation is barely a problem at all. Time
delays can be calculated, bearings crossed and a location calculated. A rigorous
and concise mathematical derivation of this is found in <i>Magnus Wahlberg et al</i>. However biological studies are not conducted in vacuum, seawater is not a still homogeneous
medium and ceteceans are not perfectly spherical acoustic sources. As discussed in the localisation overiew section error is inherent in every part of a hydrophone monitoring system, from the position of
the hydrophone, to the digitisation and cross correlation of a detected porpoise
click. Therefore instead of having cones, which perfectly intersect at the exact
location of the cetecean, in reality there exists a set of cones, which roughly
intersect each other in a certain area or perhaps do not intersect at all. This
creates an obvious problem. If there is no exact intersection point, where is the
cetecean?
The process of calculating and crossing bearings to find an intersection point
is generally named the inverse problem. The inverse problem refers to a situation were for a given set of observations (time delays) the initial parameters
(location of the cetecean) are directly calculated. The advantage of this system
is that it is very computational efficient however, it is also particularly vulnerable to errors. Although cones may roughly intersect around a likely cetecean position,
quantification of the error in location is difficult and therefore the inverse problem does not provide an
intuitive or satisfactory solution to real world localisation.
Instead for many localisation algorithms one must look at the forward problem: calculating the observeabes
from a given set of parameters. In terms of localisation this refers to selecting a
point in space, calculated the theoretical time delays if the cetecean was vocalising at this
point in space and then comparing the theoretical delays to the actual observed
time delays. The more similar the theoretical and observed time delays the
closer the point in space is to the actual position of the source position. By sampling many d

<br><br>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a Bayesian statistical technique that
has been applied to a large variety of problems, from estimating the solutions
of complex integrals, to searching for exo-planets. The basic premise is
to calculate a series of estimates which gradually increase in accuracy until a
satisfactory solution is reached. The estimates form a chain of results which
then bounces around the likely solution creating a probability distribution of
results.
<br><br>
In terms of acoustic localisation MCMC is particularly useful due to its
ability to easily incorporate experimental unknowns and then provide dynamic
visualisations of the resulting errors. Utilising both real and simulated data
this allows rigorous analysis of the effectiveness of a hydrophone array and easy
quantification of the error for each individual localisation.
<br>For acoustic localisation, parameter space generally refers to the Cartesian (or other) co-
ordinates (x,y,z) but could also include other variables which would alter the
theoretical time delays. These can include sound speed, salinity, hydrophone
positions, and/or the angle of a vertical array. 
<br>The process begins with a random point in parameter space. 
From this initial point in space
a random jump is executed. A jump involves changing each parameter value
by a limited but random value. For example if the only parameters changing
were the x.y,z co-ordinates then each jump would simply be a random jump
through 3D space. Once a jump is executed a measurement of whether the new
parameters are closer to the solution is undertaken. This is a chi squared 
value. The chi squared value compares the theoretical time delays calculated from the
new jump location to the observed time delays. The lower the chi squared value the
greater the similarity is between the theoretical and observed values.
After jumping and calculating the new chi squared value the Markov chain then
follows a series of three sequential rules. These are based on the difference
between the previous and new chi squared values;<br><br><br>
1. If the new chi squared value is less than the previous chi squared value then the jump is accepted.<br><br>
2. If the new chi squared value is greater than the previous chi squared value then the jump is only accepted with a probability of;<br>

were delta chi squared is the difference in chi squared between the previous and new jump point.<br><br> 

3. If neither of the two above criteria is achieved the jump is not accepted
and another random jump is executed from the previous point.<br><br>

The result is a sequence or chain of jumps, which converge to form a cloud
of points around the likely position of the acoustic source. The density of this cloud
then represents the probability distribution of the acoustic source location in space. Figure 1. shows three  MCMC chains converging to form a circular probability distribution. Here the acoustic source could be anywhere on a circle of possible locations, a common result when using linear arrays.

Although this process requires large amounts of computational power  the rapid progress of multi-core computing means it is possible to have
multiple chains without a large increase in computational time. <br></p>
