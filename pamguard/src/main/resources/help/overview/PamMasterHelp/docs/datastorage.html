<h1>Data Storage</h1>
<p>PAMGuard has two data storage options:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../utilities/generalDatabaseHelp/docs/database_database.html">The Database</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../utilities/BinaryStore.docs/binarystore_overview.html">The Binary Store</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each has advantages and disadvantaged. </P>
<p>The great advantage of the database is that stored data are generally in a form which is each to read either as a human, 
or via some other software.</p>
<p>However, the database interface can be slow and the database is very inefficient at handling variable length records, such as the 
waveform of a click, or the contour of a whistle. </p>
<p>The Binary store is fast and is great at handling any type of data, but the files are impossible to read except 
with proprietary computer software</p>
