<h1>PAMGUARD</h1>
<h2>Mixed Mode Operation</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
PAMGUARD Mixed Mode is used to re-analyse data stored in audio files off-line.<p>
When running in mixed mode, the PAMGUARD clock is set from the time in the name of the file and
the current position within a file of audio data. <p>
GPS data is read back from the database in synch with the  PAMGUARD clock and sent into
the PAMGUARD system exactly as though it was being collected in real time. <p>
Any localisations calculated by PAMGUARD will therefore be based on the correct GPS data 
for the time at which the event occurred. 
<p>
The overall look of PAMGUARD is also identical to that experienced during real time operation at sea. 
<p>
New detections and localisations are written to the database. 
GPS data recycled through the system are not re-written to the database. 

<h3>Starting PAMGUARD Mixed mode operation</h3>
<p>
PAMGUARD Mixed mode can be started from the shortcut to PAMGUARD mixed mode placed on your system when 
you installed PAMGUARD. 
<p>
If you are using one of the platform independent jar files, then run the jar file with the 
program argument -m. For instance, 
under Windows, the command line for starting PAMGUARD Beta version 1.3.02 in mixed mode with 1 Gigabyte of memory 
is:  <br><br>
<center><p>java -jar -mx1024m PamguardBeta_1_3_02.jar Pamguard -m</p></center> 


<h3>Running PAMGUARD Mixed Mode</h3>
<p>When PAMGUARD starts in Mixed mode, it will not ask for a psf file, but will instead ask for 
a database file to open. <p>
You must select a database which was previously filled with data from PAMGUARD. 
<p>
As with <a href="viewerMode.html">Viewer mode</a>, PAMGUARD will read it's configuration settings
from the database and not from a psf file. 
<p>
Configure the <a href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">sound 
acquisition module</a> to take data either from a file or a file 
folder. 
<p>
When you start PAMGUARD, there may be a pause of a few seconds as GPS and other data are extracted from
the database. 
<p>
Including a <a href="../../../sound_processing/soundPlaybackHelp/docs/soundPlayback_soundPlayback.html">
sound output module</a> in your model will enable you to hear the sounds and will also control the speed
of analysis so that data are analysed in real time. 
<p>
If you do not include a <a href="../../../sound_processing/soundPlaybackHelp/docs/soundPlayback_soundPlayback.html">
sound output module</a>, data will be processed as fast as the machine is able. GPS data will however remain 
fully synchronised with the audio data.
