<h1>PAMGUARD</h1>
<h2>Normal Operation</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
During normal operation, PAMGUARD collects data in real time via sound cards, GPS feeds, etc. 
<p>
The data are processed in real time by the PAMGUARD modules and summary information
is displayed on the PAMGUARD GUI and / or written to the PAMGUARD database.  

<p>
<h3>Running PAMGUARD</h3>
<p>
(If you're reading this, you've probably already worked this out !)
<p>
If you've used one of the platform dependent installers, then you should 
start PAMGUARD from one of the shortcuts placed in your system menus. This will 
check that you have a compatible JAVA virtual machine installed and will allocate
additional memory. 
<p>
If you are running one of the platform independent jar files, then you should 
tell the JAVA virtual machine to allocate as much memory as possible. For instance, 
under Windows, the command line for starting PAMGUARD Beta version 1.3.02 with 1 Gigabyte of memory 
is:  <br><br>
<center><p>java -jar -mx1024m PamguardBeta_1_3_02.jar Pamguard</p></center> 

<h3>The PSF File</h3>
<p>
PAMGUARD saves it's configuration between runs in PAMGUARD Settings Files (.psf). 
<p>
Each time you start PAMGUARD a dialog will open asking you to select the psf file
you want to use. <p>
<center><img alt="Start Dialog" src="images/startupDialog.png"/></center></p><br>
<p>Either select a recently used psf from the drop down list or press the browse button
to select a psf file stored elsewhere on your system.
<p>
Sample psf files may be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.pamguard.org">www.pamguard.org</a> web site.
