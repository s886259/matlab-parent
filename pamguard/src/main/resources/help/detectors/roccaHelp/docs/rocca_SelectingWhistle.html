<h1>Rocca</h1>
<h2>Selecting a Whistle</h2><br>
<p>To classify a whistle using Rocca, the user must first select the whistle from the scrolling spectrogram display. Move the  cursor to one corner of the whistle,  press and hold the mouse button while dragging the cursor to the opposite corner, and release the button. A red box will be drawn around the selection, and the time and frequency of the starting point (lower left corner) and ending point (upper right corner) are displayed in the Rocca sidebar for reference.  </p>

<p>When the mouse button is released, a new window will be opened containing that portion of the spectrogram selected by the user. The new window is minimized automatically.</p>
<p>If a <a href="rocca_Sidebar.html">Detection Number</a> has not yet been specified, the user will be prompted for one first.</p>
<p>At this stage, the whistle of interest has been captured and the user is able to continue monitoring the scrolling spectrogram for additional acoustic events.  The user does NOT need to classify the whistle immediately.  The number of captured whistles is only limited by the amount of memory available on the computer.</p>
