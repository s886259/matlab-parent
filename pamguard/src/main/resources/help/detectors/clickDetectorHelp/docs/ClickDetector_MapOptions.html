<h1>Click Detector</h1>
<h2>Click Detector Map Options</h2><br>

<h3>Click Detector Map Options</h3>
<p>Click detector map options are accessed from the <em><strong>Click Display>Map Options…</strong></em> menu.</p>

<p>These apply only to automatically detected click trains.</p>

<p>Click trains may contain varying levels of information.
Short click trains will only have a bearing to the detected source. 
Longer trains that alter bearing by more than a few degrees will also have a calculated range. </p>

<p>Sequences of sperm whale clicks from a single source are generally broken up into shorter trains by the click train detection algorithm. </p>

<p>Click trains with range information are always shown. The shorter and more numerous click trains that do not have range information can rapidly clutter the map.</p>
<p>By selecting the radio buttons the operator can choose to plot either: </p>
<ul><li><p>none of the short click trains,</p> </li>
  <li><p>all of the short click trains, </p></li>
  <li><p>or only those which are separated from other plotted click trains by a minimum time interval or change in bearing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If no range information is present, the bearing lines on the map are drawn at a fixed length.
