<h1>Whistle and Moan Detector</h1>
<h2>Branching and Joining</h2>
<p><br>
It is often the case that multiple whistles from different animals will
overlap in time and frequency. If large groups of dolphins are
encountered, then overlapping whistles tend to be the norm rather than
the exception. While this may not be a problem if you are only
interested in detecting whistles, if you are measuring bearings to
individual whistles or if you are using the <a
	href="../../whistleClassifierHelp/docs/whistleClassifier_Overview.html">
Whistle Classifier</a> it is necessary to separate out the different sounds.</p>
<p>The Whistle and Moan detector has four options which control how
overlapping whistles are handled</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Leave branched regions intact</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Discard branched regions</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Separate all branches</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Re-link across joins</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>This option is set at the bottom of the Whistle and Moan
configuration dialog.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>The different options are illustrated below using three simulated
overlapping linear chirps.</p>
<h3>Leave branched regions intact</h3>
<p>If this option is selected, then branched regions will be left
intact and may contain more one actual sound.</p>
<br>

<br>

<h3>Discard branched joins</h3>
<p>If this option is selected, than any region that has more than
one detected frequency peak in any time slice will be discarded.</p>
<br>

<h3>Separate all branches</h3>
<p>If this option is selected, then all branches will be separated
and passed on as individual sounds. A break is created every time the
number of consecutive peaks changes. So a pair of crossing whistles will
generally be broken into five parts - each of the four branches and the
crossing point itself.</p>
<p>In the example below, the three sounds have been broken into 12
separate parts.</p>

<br>

<h3>Re-link across joins</h3>
<p>If this option is selected, then the algorithm will attempt to
rejoin individual tones across joins. First, the sound is broken up as
above, it then rejoins the different components according to the
following rules:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p>If there are the same number of sounds in consecutive time
	slices and each sound in the earlier slice is in contact with one in
	the later slice, then they are joined with 1:1 correspondence.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A crossing point is defined as a sound which has the same number
	of other sounds entering it as leave it and has a total length no
	longer than the set maximum in the options dialog. Sounds entering
	and leaving a cross are linked across it with the highest frequency
	sound on one side joining the lowest frequency sound on the other.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>
	If there is a branch (one sound splitting to two or more) or a
	join (two or more sounds merging into one), then the frequency gradient
	of the merged part is compared to that of the sounds entering or
	leaving and the sound with the best match is joined to the merged
	section. Very short sections (fewer than 10 time slices) are penalised
	during the comparison to favour longer whistles.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p>Which branching and joining method you chose may depend on the application. 
Generally, re-linking across joins is the best option for small cetacean whistles.
