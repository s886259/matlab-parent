<h1>Whistle and Moan Detector</h1>
<h2>Connected Region Search</h2>
<p><br>
Once the <a href="WhistleMoan_ConfigNoise.html#thresholding">threshold</a>
has been applied to the spectrogram data in the <a
	href="whistleMoan_ConfigNoise.html#">noise removal</a> stage, the
Whistle and Moan detector searches for connected regions in the
spectrogram matrix.</p>

<br>
<h3>Min Frequency and Max Frequency</h3>
<p>Usually, you will want the Whistle and Moan detector to search
the whole range of available frequencies, from 0 Hz to half the sample
rate. However, these parameters give you the opportunity to limit the
connected region search to a specific frequency band. This can be
particularly useful if your data are contaminated by a lot of noise at a
particular frequency.</p>

<h3>Connection Type</h3>
<p>When searching for connected regions, two main connection types
are available.</p>
<p>Connect 4 tries to connect each pixel to other pixels directly
above, below, to the left or to the right (i.e. 4 possible connections).</p>
<p>Connect 8 tries to connect to the sides and on the diagonals (i.e.
8 possible connections).</p>
<p>Clearly connect 8 will detect more whistles and can also detect
whistles sweeping more rapidly, however connect 8 may also be prone to a
higher rate of false alarm if it connects things which shouldn't be
connected.</p>


<h3>Minimum length and Minimum total size</h3>
<p>There will always be a small number of random spectrogram pixels which are above threshold
but are not part of a whistle or tone. Generally (hopefully !) these will few in 
number and the chances of them connecting to other random pixels to make a large connected region 
will be small.</p>
<p>All connected regions which are shorter than the minimum length, or have fewer pixels than the minimum 
total size will be discarded.</p>
