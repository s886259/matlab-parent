<h1>Whistle and Moan Detector</h1>
<h2>Channel Grouping and Bearing Calculations</h2>
<p>
  The Whistle and Moan detector can operate on one or more channels of data. It can also measure time
  delays between the arrival of sounds on different channels and use these to calculate bearings, and in 
  some instances ranges to detected sounds. 
</p>
<p>Which channels the Whistle and Moan detector detects on and which channels it uses for bearing and range
calculations is controlled by the channel grouping section of the options dialog.</p>

<br>
<p>When a <a href="whistleMoan_ConfigSource.html">data source</a> is selected, the dialog will 
show a series of check boxes, one for each channel. Select the channels you want to use for detection 
OR bearing calculation, then to the right of each channel check box, assign the channel to a group. The group 
numbers themselves are not important - they just need to be different for each group.</p>

<p>The Whistle and Moan detector will detect sounds only on the first channel in each group.</p>
<p>If a sound is detected, it will then use data from other channels in the same group to measure time 
delays between the arrival of the signal on the different channels. 
The Whistle and Moan detector will do this independently for each group.</p>

<h4>Measuring Range</h4>
<p>If more than one group is present, then if whistles which overlap in time and frequency are detected on more than one
channel group, the Whistle and Moan detector will attempt to cross the bearings measured within each channel group in 
order to estimate a range to the sound.</p>
<p>The example above was set up to work with a hydrophone array which consisted of four hydrophones arranged in two pairs.
 The separation of each pair was 3m and the distance between pairs was 200m. Detection and bearing calculation was conducted 
 independently from each pair, and the bearings from the two pairs then crossed to estimate ranges.</p>
