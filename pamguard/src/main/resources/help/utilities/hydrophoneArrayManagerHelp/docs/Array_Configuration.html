<h1>Hydrophone Array</h1>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p><br>
The array configuration dialog is opened from the <em><strong>File>Hydrophone
array</strong></em> menu.</p>
<p><img alt="Hydrophone array dialog"
	src="./Images/ArrayConfiguration.png" /><br>
<br>

The array dialog is divided into five distinct regions.</p>
<p><i>Hydrophone Positions</i> provides a graphical display of the
hydrophone positions within the array. Physical hydrophone numbers are
shown in black. Software channel numbers are shown in red. It is
possible, if no software channel is connected to a particular hydrophone
that the software channel will be absent for some hydrophones.</p>
<p><i>Array Configuration</i> lists the individual hydrophone
elements making up the array.</p>
<p><i>Channel Configuration</i> lists the software channels
associated with a sound source (needs cross reference here to something
in sound source help).</p>
<p><i>Environment</i> lists environmental parameters.</p>
<p><i>Array Management</i> Allows you to create, import, export and
rename different hydrophone arrays.</p>
<h3>Hydrophone Positions</h3>
<p>This part of the dialog is for information purposes only and
there are no configuration options. Hydrophone positions are shown relative 
to the PAMGUARD GPS coordinate. </p>
<h4>Coordinate Frame</h4>
<p>It is assumed that the vessel's GPS is at (x,y) = (0,0) and is travelling
in the forward (increasing) y direction. Consequently, for an array
towed astern of the vessel, y coordinates are generally negative
numbers. For a single array in the centre line of the vessel with a
centrally mounted GPS, all x coordinates will be zero, etc. For display
purposes, depth is entered as a positive number, however, developers
should be aware that within the PAMGUARD data model, the positive z
coordinate is upwards, therefore depths are stored as negative numbers.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Array Configuration</h3>
<p>This lists the individual hydrophone elements making up an array.
</p>
<h4>Selecting an array</h4>
<p>If more than one array is available (stored on the computer), a
particular array may be selected using the drop down list. Note that
only one array is loaded at any one time.</p>
<h4>Static and Towed Arrays</h4>
<p>PAMGUARD supports both static and towed hydrophone arrays.</p>
<p>When a <b>static array</b> is selected hydrophone locations are
calculated relative to a reference point (specified by its Latitude and
Longitude) entered by the user.</p>
<p>When a <b>towed array</b> is selected actual hydrophone
locations, and consequently detection locations, are calculated relative
to the GPS receiver connected to PAMGUARD.</p>
<p>A towed hydrophone streams behind a moving vessel. The locations
of hydrophone elements within the array can be calculated using two
different methods selected from the <em><strong>Locator</strong></em>
drop down menu.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><b>Straight / rigid hydrophone</p></b>
	<p>The hydrophone sticks out of the back (or the front) of the
	vessel in a straight line as though it were mounted rigidly on the
	vessel. This would be suitable for a hull mounted hydrophone, but for a
	towed hydrophone will give inaccurate locations during turns.</p>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li><p><b>Threading Hydrophone</p></b>
	<p>A threading hydrophone is assumed to exactly follow the track of
	the vessel, even during turns and will give more accurate positions for
	a towed array. The threading model assumes that the vessels track is
	followed precisely and the the array does not 'cut corners' in any way.
	This is not precisely true, but is a more reasonable approximation than
	the straight locator.</p>
	<p></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h4>Streamers</h4>
<p>
If you are using a towed array you should define one or more streamers which will
be shown in the Hydrophone Streamers table. 
</p>
<p>Use the Add, Edit and Delete buttons to add, edit and delete streamers. 
You will not be able to remove the last streamer. </p>
</p>
<p>
As well as defining the position of each streamer in x, y and depth, you should input an error on the 
accuracy of each of the three coordinates. 
</p>
<h4>Hydrophones</h4>
<p>The list area shows information about each individual hydrophone which will be shown in the 
Hydrophone Elements table.
<p>Each hydrophone is given a unique Id which is referred to in the
Channel Configuration section.</p>


<h4>Editing an Array</h4>

<h5>Adding or Editing a Streamer</h5>
<p>Press the Add button below the Hydrophone Streamers table or select and existing
streamer in the table and either double click on the table or press the Edit
button and the <a href="Array_NewStreamer.html">Streamer Dialog</a> will appear.</p>
<h5>Deleting a Streamer</h5>
<p>Select a Streamer
in the table (the Delete button is disabled if no hydrophone is
selected). You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete a
hydrophone. </p>


<H5>Adding or Editing a Hydrophone</H5>
<p>Press the Add button below the Hydrophone Elements table or select and existing
hydrophone in the table and either double click on the table or press the Edit
button and the <a href="Array_NewHydrophone.html">Hydrophone Dialog</a> will appear.</p>
<H5>Deleting a hydrophone</H5>
<p>Select a hydrophone
in the table (the Delete button is disabled if no hydrophone is
selected). You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete a
hydrophone. </p>
<br>

<h3>Channel Configuration</h3>
<p>The first stage of most PAM processes is to acquire the sound
with a digitiser (e.g. a <a
	href="../../../sound_processing/AcquisitionHelp/docs/AcquisitionOverview.html">sound
card</a>) or some other Sound Acquisition module within the PAMGUARD model.
</p>
<p>It is possible for PAMGUARD to operate with more than one Sound
Acquisition module and a one-to-many relationship can exist between
hydrophones and data channels within the sound acquisition modules. For
instance, a single multi-element array may contain both low and high
frequency hydrophones, some of which are connected to a low frequency
digitiser and other high frequency hydrophones.</p>
<p>The drop down list at the top of the Channel Configuration panel
will list all Sound Acquisition Modules currently instantiated in the
PAMGUARD data model. Information on a single Sound Acquisition module is
displayed at any one time.</p>
<p>By default, when a sound acquisition module is created, it will
map it's channels 1 to 1 to the PAMGUARD array. To change these
mappings, select the software channel of interest in the Channel
Configuration panel and press 'Change hydrophone' and select the
hydrophone you want to relate to that software channel.</p>
<p>Other parameters displayed in the list area of the Channel
Configuration panel are set in the Sound Acquisition dialog and are for
information only.</p>
<br>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>This currently contains the speed of sound in sea water and an estimate of
the error on the speed of sound measurement.</p>
<p>(It is possible that future releases of PAMGUARD will allow entry
of a sound speed profile here ).</p>
<br>

<h3>Array Management</h3>
<p>When you have finished with the PAMGUARD Hydrophone Array dialog,
press the <em><strong>OK </strong></em>button.</p>
<p>To exit without saving changes, press<em><strong>
Cancel</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Other buttons perform the following actions:</p>
<p><strong>New Array</strong>: Creates a new PAMGUARD
hydrophone array</p>
<p><strong>Copy</strong>: Copies the currently loaded array</p>
<p><strong>Rename</strong>: Renames the currently loaded
array</p>
<p><strong>Import</strong>: Imports a hydrophone array from a
PAMGUARD Array File (.paf)</p>
<p><strong>Export</strong>: Exports the currently selected
array to a PAMGUARD Array File (.paf)</p>
<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Deletes the currently selected
array.</p>
