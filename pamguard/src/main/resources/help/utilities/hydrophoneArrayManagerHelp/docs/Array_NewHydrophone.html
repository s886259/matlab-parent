Assign the hydrophone to a streamer from the drop down list.</p>

The hydrophone type is for information only.</p>
<p>
Enter the x,y, and depth coordinates and estimates of the errors on those coordinates.</p>

The sensitivity, preamplifier gain and combined bandwidth

combination) are taken by default from the previously selected hydrophone 
(to save you having to repeatedly type them in for multi-element arrays.
