<h1>Binary Storage</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The database is not well suited for all types of data, particularly those such as clicks or whistle contours which have 
a varying length. The binary storage system stores PAMGUARD output in a proprietary data format which is simple and efficient and
can handle any type of data.</p>
<p>Data stored using the binary store can be reviewed with the 
<a href="../../../overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/viewerMode.html">PAMGUARD viewer</a>. It is also possible to open the binary files using 
your own software written in other programming languages such as Matlab.</p> 
   
</p>
<h3>Adding a Binary Storage module</h3>
<p>
From the <strong><em>File>Add Modules>Utilities</em></strong> menu select <i>'Binary Storage'</i> to add binary storage to your
configuration.</p>

<h3>Configuring the Binary Store</h3>
<p>To configure the binary store, go to the <strong><em>File>Binary Storage</em></strong>... menu to open the Binary Storage dialog. </p>

</p>
<p>Select the folder where you want to store the data and optionally set the other three options.</p>
<p>Storing data in folders arranged by date can help with data backup and archiving.</p>
<p>Automatically starting new files is important in order that individual files do not get excessively large. </p>
<p>The binary store can start new files at fixed time intervals, when files reach a certain size or both (i.e. which ever condition 
occurs first).</p>

<h3>Output Files</h3>
<p>Output files are identified by a long name which contains the module type, the module name, the datablock name, the date and the time. e.g. 
Clicks from a <a href="../../../detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickDetector.html">Click Detector</a> 
called "Porpoise Detector" will have a name like  "Click_Detector_Porpoise_Detector_Clicks_20100331_142400.pgdf"</p>

<h4>pgdf Files</h4>
<p>pgdf files are the main files which contain the binary data. All pgdf files have a common header and footer structure (i.e. 
the data at the start and at the end of each file). Individual units of data are however different for each module.</p>
<h4>pgdx Files</h4>
<p>pgdx files are indexing files. They contain headers and footers which are identical to those in the pgdf files, but no data. pgdx files 
speed up indexing processes at the start of a PAMGUARD viewer session.</p> 
<h4>psfx Files</h4>
<p>psfx files contain PAMGUARD configuration data. These are basically the same data are as stored in the standard PAMGUARD configuration files, but
wrapped with a data ane other information.</p><p>One of these is written each time PAMGUARD is started, providing a permanent record of 
PAMGUARD settings. psfx files can be loaded into the PAMGUARD Viewer from the viewer <a href="../../../utilities/datamap/docs/datamap.html">data map</a>. </p>
