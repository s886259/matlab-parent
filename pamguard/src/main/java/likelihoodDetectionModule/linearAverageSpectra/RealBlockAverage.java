/** This is a helper class to compute block averages.  The first time processData is called,
 *  it creates a block of memory the same length as the data passed to the processData() method.
 *  After each call to processData, the user can check the status by calling averageReady().
 *  After an average is computed (averageReady() returns true), no more data will be accepted
 *  until you call the average() method to collect the results.
 *  The averageTimestamp() and averageAbsBlockIndex() return the timestamp and AbsBlockIndex of the
 *  averaged result.  The timestamp is that of the first block used in computing the average,
 *  FIXME what to do with AbsBlockIndex
