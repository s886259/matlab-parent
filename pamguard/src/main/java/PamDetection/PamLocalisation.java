/**
 * General class for handling localisation information for 
 * a PamDetection. Note that PamDetections may have lists of 
 * subDetections and superDetections (e.g. a click is a sub detection 
 * of a click train, a click train is a super detection of a click; 
 * a Whistle Peak is a sub detection of a Whistle Shape, etc.)
 * <p>
 * It's quite possible that the sub detections and the super detection 
 * will all have, or not have localisation information and the amount of
 * information will vary depending on the detection. 
 * <p> 
 * This class therefore has a lot of has? type functions to see what
 * types of information are available. Of course, these meed not always 
 * be called by many detectors, for instance, the simple IFAW 2 channel 
 * click detector knows that there will always be bearing information 
 * and no other information for every click. Generic plotting routines 
 * may find this stuff really useful though as might detectors / localisers 
 * that may be able to extract varying degrees of information from a 
 * detection.
