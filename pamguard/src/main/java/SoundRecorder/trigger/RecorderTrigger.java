/**
 * RecorderTriggers are used to automatically make sound file 
 * recordings in response to detections, or any other PamGuard event.
 * <p>
 * A part of the PamGuard system that is to trigger recordings should 
 * first create a class that implements the RecorderTriggers interface. 
 * This class must then be registered with the PamGuard recorders using 
 * the static function void RecorderControl.addRecorderTrigger(RecorderTrigger 
 * recorderTrigger). The trigger will then be listed on the tab panel of each 
 * instance of the PamGuard recorder from where it can be enabled or disabled 
 * for each recorder independently. 
 * <p>
 * When an event occurs which should start a recording, call the static 
 * function void RecorderControl.actionRecorderTrigger(RecorderTrigger 
 * recorderTrigger). Each instance of the recorder will then be notified 
 * and will start recording depending on the state of check box on each 
 * recorder tab on the GUI.
 * <p>
 * Note that the RecorderTrigger passed to RecorderControl.actionRecorderTrigger
 * must be exactly the same instance as was passed to RecorderControl.addRecorderTrigger
