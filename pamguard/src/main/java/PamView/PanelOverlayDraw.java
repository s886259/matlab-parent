/**

 * @author Doug Gillespie
 *         <p>
 *         Used by PamDataBlocks to draw PamDataUnits on display objects (maps,
 *         spectrograms, etc)
 *         <p>
 *         If a PanelOverlayDraw object is instantiated for a PamObservable,
 *         then any display (usually an observer of that PamObservable) will
 *         call the PamObservable function PamObservable.DrawDataUnit(...),
 *         parsing it a Graphics2d handle, a PamDataUnit, and a concrete
 *         instance of a GeneralProjector. The DrawDataUnit function in
 *         PanelOverlayDraw may then use the Projector to convert data in the
 *         PamDatablock into screen coordinates and then draw them (in any way
 *         it likes) on the graphics handle.
 *         <p>
 *         If the Observable may be drawn on multiple types of display, then
 *         DrawDataUnit should check the ParameterTypes and ParameterUnits
 *         required by the Projector and then draw whatever is appropriate for
 *         that Projector (e.g. The Whistle DataBlock draws contours on the
 *         display that has TIME and FREQUENCY as ParameterTypes and a single
 *         triangular symbol on the display that has LATITUDE and LONGITUDE as
 *         it's parameter types).
