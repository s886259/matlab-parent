 *Any control panel for the static localiser must use this basic interface and make sure all these functions are implemented properly. The control essentially allows the user to pick a single pamdetection to pass to the localiser. It also specifies what type of detection the user wishes to localise by passing an int flag to 
 *the detectionMatch class for the pamDetection. For example, in the case of a clickDetection, the user can pass flags telling the detection match class only to include classified clicks in it's calculation of time delays.
