	 * detectionType- this is an integer flag which is datablock specific and is passed to the AbstractDetectionMatch class-usually specifies which corresponding detections to calculate time delays from.
	 *For example, 'detectiontype' in clickDetectionMatch refers to events, classified species and a combination of the two. For whistles this may refer to whistle classification etc- tdSel refers to which time delay to select. Abstractdetectionmatch creates an array of possible time delays for a given detection.
